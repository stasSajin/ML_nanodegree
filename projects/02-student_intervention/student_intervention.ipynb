    "#### **Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ** Model 1: Gradient Boosting**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:** a version of gradient boosting algorithm (extreme gradient boosting) was sucessfuly used in a large number of applications, including click prediction, store sales, inventory demand. See the list of past competitions on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?sortBy=deadline&group=all&page=1&segment=allCategories).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "* Handles high dimentional spaces well because the trees that are built are usually shallow and uses an ensamble of weak learners.\n",
    "* Shows very high accuracy accorss a variety of prediction problems. For instance, [this paper](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume15/delgado14a/delgado14a.pdf) indicates that random forest and gradient boosting came on top for the data sets in the UCI repository. \n",
    "* Handles nonlinearities in the data.\n",
    "* Can be used for classification and regression problems.\n",
    "* You can often specify how missing values should be handled.\n",
    "* You don't have to worry too much about normalizing your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "* It usually takes longer to run when compared to random forests because there are more parameters to tune and because the trees are built sequentially. Nontheless, the training time can be reduced by lowering the tree depth without affecting accuracy too much.\n",
    "* Ensemble models tend to overfit if the signal to noise ratio is very low.\n",
    "* It is not very interpretable. Though we can extract information about how often a feature is used in tree splits and how much informaiton gain a feature provides, we don't make predictions based on only one tree like in decision trees. Rather we use all the trees (which can look very different from one another in structure and features that are used during splits).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the model is a good candidate:** \n",
    "* The model tends to perform well on a variety of tasks, so I expect it to achieve fairly good accuracy on this task.\n",
    "* It handles classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ** Model 2: Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:** This is a very commonly used algorithm. An example of an applicaiton of this algorithm is in [predicting who is going to be addmited to college](http://www.math.montana.edu/grad/writing-projects/09sulock.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:** \n",
    "* The algorithm tends to perform fairly well on datasets with low signal to noise ratio (i.e., has lower chance of overfittting for those scenarios)\n",
    "* Allows us to quantify the strength of the relationship between features and outcomes. For instance, we can report exactly what the effect of number of absences is on the outcome (e.g., \"For every absence, the odds of failing increase by 2%).\n",
    "* It is computationally efficient, though it can also be memory inefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknessess:** \n",
    "* Handles only linear relationships between predictors and the outcome.\n",
    "* Does not handle missing data. You either need to remove observations with missing data or specify an imputation procedure.\n",
    "* Usually the features need to be preprocessed (e.g., centered, scaled, Box-Cox transformed).\n",
    "* Requires a binary output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the model is a good candidate:**\n",
    "* Perfect for classification cases\n",
    "* Relatively low computational costs\n",
    "* Good if we decide to average the logistic regression predictions with the gradient boosting, since it might lower overfitting. \n",
    "* We can make recommendations on which outcomes we should focus on improving. In other words, it can be actionable. For instance, if we find that absences matter a lot, we can create an interention system that specifically focuses on lowering abences. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Model 3: Naive Bayes**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications:** Spam detection and text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:** \n",
    "* It is special. Naive Bayes models belong to the class of generative models, unlike other classifiers, which fall in the class of discriminative models (see [here](https://www.rstudio.com/rviews/2016/11/02/naive-bayes-a-generative-model-and-big-data-classifier/) for discussion). This is a strength, because often Naive Bayes models give different predictions from other models, and tends to improve performance in model ensembling/stacking.\n",
    "* Can handle a lot of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**\n",
    "* Doesn't always perform well on small datasets.\n",
    "* Assumes that features are independent of each other. You have to explicitly specify in what ways features interact with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why the model is a good candidate:**\n",
    "* It will converge faster to a solution comapred to discriminative models. This means that it might be more computationally efficient, which is more in line with the requirements specified by the school."

One can think of the probability value in the output as a way of understanding how confident we are that a student is going to succeed or fail. For instance, a probability closer to 1 would indicate that we feel confident that a student is going to graduate, while a probability closer to 0 would indicate that we feel confident that a student is going to fail.
